      Hello, I’m <strong>Neeraj Kumar</strong>. My journey in tech began with curiosity and has grown into
      a passion for building reliable systems and delivering exceptional customer experiences.
      Today, I work at
      <a href="ww.sprinklr.com/Sprinklr</a>,
      where I’ve spent over <strong>4 years</strong> navigating the intersection of cloud engineering and
      customer success.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-4">
      Over the years, I’ve worn many hats—starting as a <em>Senior Engineer</em>, moving into
      leadership as <em>Manager I (Supervisor) – Cloud Engineering</em>, and now serving as a
      <em>Platinum Support Account Manager</em>. Each role taught me something new about technology,
      people, and the art of solving problems under pressure.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-4">
      Before Sprinklr, I explored product engineering during my internship at
      https://www.deltax.com/DeltaX</a>.
      My academic foundation comes from a <em>B.E. in Computer Science</em> at
      <a href="https://www.cmrit.ac.in/" class="hoverlogy</a>,
      and my schooling at
      https://kvsangathan.nic.in/Kendriya Vidyalaya</a>.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-4">
      These days, I focus on <strong>SLA management</strong>, <strong>cloud reliability</strong>, and
      <strong>customer outcomes</strong>—bringing together technical depth and leadership to make
      systems and experiences better every day.
