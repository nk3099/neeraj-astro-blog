    Current Work & Career Journey
  </h2>  <p class="text-lg">
    I’m currently a Machine Learning Engineer at PayPal, focusing on Python, SQL, and occasionally Java. 
    I’m continuously exploring and refining my skills while learning along the way.
  </p>
  
  <p class="text-lg mt-2">
    I’m actively involved in model monitoring, where my work revolves around integrating PSI scoring and KL divergence metrics. 
    I’m also diving into the L-infinity metric as defined by Google in Vertex AI.
  </p>
  
  <p class="text-lg mt-2">
    Additionally, I’m exploring the latest tech stack, including RAG-based approaches, function and tool calling, and studying MCP (Model Control Plane) and MCP servers.
  </p>
  
  <p class="mt-4 text-lg">
    Before PayPal, I worked as a Software Engineer at 
    <a href="https://chargebee.com/" class="hover:text-blue-400 underline">
      Chargebee
    </a>, where I was part of the Generative AI team. My work involved building applications using Next.js, React, JavaScript, Python, 
    and APIs like OpenAI and Claude.

    <h2 class="mt-4 font-semibold text-xl text-blue-400">Future Plans</h2>
    <p class="mt-2 text-lg">
      I was inactive for almost 6 months after I first started working on this
      webpage due to professional and personal commitments. To get back on
      track, I plan to start a "Today I Learned" (TIL) series sometime in
      March, where I will aim to write daily blogs for 100 days - Monday
      through Friday (5 times a week). This will help me stay committed to
      learning consistently and also expand my skill set.
    </p>
  
    <p class="mt-2 text-lg">
      As I sit today, my React and JavaScript skills have gotten a bit rusty,
      so I plan to work on improving them. Additionally, I want to add a
      quotes section to this webpage, where I’ll post some of the best quotes
      I’ve come across—whether from movies, books, or motivational talks.
    </p>
  
    <h2 class="mt-4 font-semibold text-xl text-blue-400">
      What I Did to Create This Webpage
    </h2>
    <p class="mt-2 text-lg">
      When I first started, I used the Hashnode API to list my blog posts. I
      began with just one post, but now I’ve added several, and I’m continuing
      to build on it. I’ve set up a webhook that updates the database whenever
      I create or edit a post. This data is dynamically used to update the
      posts and the TIL section.
    </p>
  
    <p class="mt-2 text-lg">
      In future posts, I plan to write about my experience at Chargebee,
      detailing the projects I worked on and the challenges I faced. For the
      "Today I Learned" (TIL) section, you can read more below about what it
      means to me and how I plan to use it as a way to grow and stay
      consistent in my learning journey.
    </p>
  
    <h2 class="mt-4 font-semibold text-xl text-blue-400">
      What is "TIL" About?
    </h2>
    <p class="mt-2 text-lg">
      "Today I Learned" (TIL) is my way of keeping track of what I’ve learned,
      whether it’s about work, coding, or anything else. Inspired by the
      concept of 
      <a href="https://www.swyx.io/learn-in-public" class="hover:text-blue-400 underline">
        learn-in-public
      </a>
      , it helps me stay consistent, track my growth over time, and reflect on
      the progress I’ve made. It might not be perfect, but it’s a meaningful
      step forward.
    </p>
  
    <p class="mt-2 text-lg">
      This platform might look like a mix of a blog and a portfolio for now,
      but I hope it grows into something more as I keep experimenting and
      learning.
