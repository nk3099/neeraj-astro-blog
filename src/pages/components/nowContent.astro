      I’m currently working as a Machine Learning Engineer at PayPal. My work
      mostly revolves around Python and SQL, with some occasional Java. I’m
      still figuring things out as I go, learning along the way.

      Before this, I worked as a Software Engineer at 
      <a href="https://chargebee.com/" class="hover:text-blue-400 underline">
        Chargebee
      </a>
      , where I was part of the Generative AI team. My focus was on building
      applications with tools like Next.js, React, JavaScript, Python, and
      APIs like OpenAI and Claude.

    <p class="mt-2 text-lg">
      I was inactive for almost 6 months after I first started working on this
      webpage due to professional and personal commitments. To get back on
      track, I plan to start a "Today I Learned" (TIL) series sometime in
      March, where I will aim to write daily blogs for 100 days - Monday
      through Friday (5 times a week). This will help me stay committed to
      learning consistently and also expand my skill set.
    </p>
  
    <p class="mt-2 text-lg">
      As I sit today, my React and JavaScript skills have gotten a bit rusty,
      so I plan to work on improving them. Additionally, I want to add a
      quotes section to this webpage, where I’ll post some of the best quotes
      I’ve come across—whether from movies, books, or motivational talks.
    </p>

      What I Did to Create This Webpage
    </h2>
    <p class="mt-2 text-lg">
      When I first started, I used the Hashnode API to list my blog posts. I
      began with just one post, but now I’ve added several, and I’m continuing
      to build on it. I’ve set up a webhook that updates the database whenever
      I create or edit a post. This data is dynamically used to update the
      posts and the TIL section.
    </p>
  
    <p class="mt-2 text-lg">
      In future posts, I plan to write about my experience at Chargebee,
      detailing the projects I worked on and the challenges I faced. For the
      "Today I Learned" (TIL) section, you can read more below about what it
      means to me and how I plan to use it as a way to grow and stay
      consistent in my learning journey.

      What is "TIL" About?
    </h2>
    <p class="mt-2 text-lg">
      "Today I Learned" (TIL) is my way of keeping track of what I’ve learned,
      whether it’s about work, coding, or anything else. Inspired by the
      concept of 
      <a href="https://www.swyx.io/learn-in-public" class="hover:text-blue-400 underline">
        learn-in-public
      </a>
      , it helps me stay consistent, track my growth over time, and reflect on
      the progress I’ve made. It might not be perfect, but it’s a meaningful
      step forward.
    </p>
  
    <p class="mt-2 text-lg">
      This platform might look like a mix of a blog and a portfolio for now,
      but I hope it grows into something more as I keep experimenting and
      learning.
